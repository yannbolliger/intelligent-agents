\title{\bf Excercise 1.\\ Implementing a first Application in RePast: A Rabbits Grass Simulation.}
\author{Group \textnumero: 90  Kyle GÃ©rard, Yann Bolliger}

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Assumptions}
In our model the grass growth is bounded above linearly. 
That means that in each tick of the simulation there are \textit{at most} \texttt{grassGrowthRate} 
new squares of grass. For each of them we choose one square at random and put grass there even 
if it was already present. The energy of the grass in a cell is always equal to 
\texttt{grassEnergy}. This can be adjusted as a parameter.
 
 - rabbits can be born on grass
 - if rabbits can't move, they don't move but they still loose energy (1)
 - rabbits can go back and forth
 - default birth energy 30

\subsection{Implementation Remarks}
% Provide important details about your implementation, such as handling
of boundary conditions %

\section{Results}
% In this section, you study and describe how different variables
(e.g. birth threshold, grass growth rate etc.) or combinations of variables
influence the results. Different experiments with diffrent settings are
described below with your observations and analysis
