\section{Solution Representation}

\subsection{Variables} 

Instead of representing a vehicle's journey as a sequence of tasks, we chose to
represent it as a sequence of $pickup$ and $delivery$ actions. Each task 
$t \in \mathcal{T}$
has one action of both types.

$$
\mathcal{P} = \{pickup(t) : t \in \mathcal{T}\} , \;  
\mathcal{D} = \{delivery(t) : t \in \mathcal{T}\} , \; 
\mathcal{A} =  \mathcal{P} \cup \mathcal{D}
$$

This accounts for the fact that a vehicle can carry multiple tasks at a time if
there are two pickups in a row. The following variables define the 
first pickup of each vehicle (where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set vehicles). 

$$
\forall v \in \mathcal{V}  : \;
firstPickup(v)  \in \mathcal{P} \cup \{\mathtt{null}\} 
$$

If the variable is $\mathtt{null}$ this means the vehicle does not accomplish
any actions. All subsequent actions of a vehicle are defined by the next set of
variables:

$$
\forall a \in \mathcal{A}  : \;
nextAction(a) \in \mathcal{A}  \cup \{\mathtt{null}\} 
$$

where again the $\mathtt{null}$ signifies that a vehicle has no further actions
to perform. We will define two other sets of variables which will clarify the
former:

$$
\forall a \in \mathcal{A}  :
vehicle(a) \in \mathcal{V};
\;\;
\forall a \in \mathcal{A}  :
time(a) \in \{0, 1, 2, ...\}
$$

The $vehicle$ variables define which vehicle carries out a certain action.
This can be derived from the $firstPickup$ action at the start of
each action chain defined by $nextAction$. (For example if
$firstPickup(v) = a, nextAction(a) = b$ then 
$vehicle(a) = vehicle(b) = v$.)

The second variable can also be 
derived from the action chains. It simply gives the rank of each action
in the chain (for example if 
$firstPickup(v) = a, nextAction(a) = b$ then $time(a) = 1$, $time(b) = 2$).
